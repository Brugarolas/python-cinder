/*
 * Shadow frames are an optimization used by the JIT to avoid allocating
 * PyFrameObjects unless absolutely necessary (e.g. when a user calls
 * sys._getframe()).
 *
 * Shadow frames are allocated by both the interpreter and JIT-compiled
 * functions either on the system stack or in generator object instances and
 * linked into a call stack with the top linked to in PyThreadState.
 *
 * When a user requests a Python frame for a JIT-compiled function, the runtime
 * will allocate one and insert it into the appropriate place in chain of
 * PyFrameObjects. If the JIT-compiled function corresponded to a generator,
 * the newly allocated PyFrameObject will be linked to the corresponding
 * generator for the rest of its execution. Subsequent requests for a Python
 * frame will update the previously allocated Python frame to reflect the
 * current execution state of the JIT-compiled function.
 *
 * In addition to allowing materialization of PyFrameObjects, shadow frames
 * provide enough information for introspection of the PyCodeObject's for all
 * active functions in the current call-stack.
 *
 * For stack introspection, we'll want to walk either the synchronous call
 * stack or the "await stack" and retrieve the PyCodeObject for each member.
 * The synchronous call stack is represented by the linked-list of shadow
 * frames that begins at the top-most shadow frame of the current thread.
 * The "await stack" consists of the chain of coroutines that are
 * transitively awaiting on the top-most coroutine of the current
 * thread. This chain is threaded through the coroutine object; to recover it
 * from a shadow frame, we must be able to go from a shadow frame to its
 * associated coroutine object. To do this we take advantage of shadow frames
 * for generator-like functions being stored within the associated PyGenObject.
 * Thus we can recover a pointer of the PyGenObject at a fixed offset from a
 * shadow frame pointer. We can use other data in the shadow frame to determine
 * if it refers to a generator function and so such a translation is valid.

/* Who is responsible for unlinking the frame.
 *
 * This is used by the JIT for a couple of different purposes.
 *
 * First, it's used to identify which pre-existing PyFrameObjects need to be
 * updated when something calls `sys.getframe()` or `PyEval_GetFrame()`. There
 * may be shadow frames for JIT-compiled functions that are on the call stack
 * for which corresponding PyFrameObjects have already been materialized. Those
 * PyFrameObjects should be updated to reflect the current execution state of
 * the corresponding Python function. However, we want to ignore PyFrameObjects
 * for shadow frames that are owned by the interpreter. Both cases will have a
 * `pointer_kind` of `PYSF_PYFRAME`; we use the `owner` field to disambiguate
 * between the two.
 *
 * Second, it determines when it is safe to cast a `_PyShadowFrame` to a
 * `JITShadowFrame`. A shadow frame with PYSF_JIT as its owner flag will be a
 * JITShadowFrame if and only if it's not a generator. JIT generators do not
 * have a JITShadowFrame to avoid bloating non-JIT generator objects as the
 * shadow frame is embedded directly in the generator. There are plans to move
 * the shadow frame out of the generator, at which point we'll allocate a
 * JITShadowFrame for generators too, and remove the special case.
 *
 * TODO(T118377200) - Rename to _PyShadowFrameKind once JIT generators
 * have a JITShadowFrame.
